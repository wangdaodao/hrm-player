The following examples demonstrate some of the situations where this\n * distinction is important. Note that all of these cases involve demuxed content. When\n * content is muxed, the audio and video are packaged together, therefore syncing\n * separate media playlists is not an issue.\n *\n * CASE 1: Audio prepares to load a new timeline before video:\n *\n * Timeline:       0                 1\n * Audio Segments: 0 1 2 3 4 5 DISCO 6 7 8 9\n * Audio Loader:                     ^\n * Video Segments: 0 1 2 3 4 5 DISCO 6 7 8 9\n * Video Loader              ^\n *\n * In the above example, the audio loader is preparing to load the 6th segment, the first\n * after a discontinuity, while the video loader is still loading the 5th segment, before\n * the discontinuity.\n *\n * If the audio loader goes ahead and loads and appends the 6th segment before the video\n * loader crosses the discontinuity, then when appended, the 6th audio segment will use\n * the timestamp offset from timeline 0. This will likely lead to desyncing. In addition,\n * the audio loader must provide the audioAppendStart value to trim the content in the\n * transmuxer, and that value relies on the audio timestamp offset. Since the audio\n * timestamp offset is set by the video (main) loader, the audio loader shouldn't load the\n * segment until that value is provided.\n *\n * CASE 2: Video prepares to load a new timeline before audio:\n *\n * Timeline:       0                 1\n * Audio Segments: 0 1 2 3 4 5 DISCO 6 7 8 9\n * Audio Loader:             ^\n * Video Segments: 0 1 2 3 4 5 DISCO 6 7 8 9\n * Video Loader                      ^\n *\n * In the above example, the video loader is preparing to load the 6th segment, the first\n * after a discontinuity, while the audio loader is still loading the 5th segment, before\n * the discontinuity.\n *\n * If the video loader goes ahead and loads and appends the 6th segment, then once the\n * segment is loaded and processed, both the video and audio timestamp offsets will be\n * set, since video is used as the primary timing source. This is to ensure content lines\n * up appropriately, as any modifications to the video timing are reflected by audio when\n * the video loader sets the audio and video timestamp offsets to the same value. However,\n * setting the timestamp offset for audio before audio has had a chance to change\n * timelines will likely lead to desyncing, as the audio loader will append segment 5 with\n * a timestamp intended to apply to segments from timeline 1 rather than timeline 0.\n *\n * CASE 3: When seeking, audio prepares to load a new timeline before video\n *\n * Timeline:       0                 1\n * Audio Segments: 0 1 2 3 4 5 DISCO 6 7 8 9\n * Audio Loader:           ^\n * Video Segments: 0 1 2 3 4 5 DISCO 6 7 8 9\n * Video Loader            ^\n *\n * In the above example, both audio and video loaders are loading segments from timeline\n * 0, but imagine that the seek originated from timeline 1.\n *\n * When seeking to a new timeline, the timestamp offset will be set based on the expected\n * segment start of the loaded video segment. In order to maintain sync, the audio loader\n * must wait for the video loader to load its segment and update both the audio and video\n * timestamp offsets before it may load and append its own segment. This is the case\n * whether the seek results in a mismatched segment request (e.g., the audio loader\n * chooses to load segment 3 and the video loader chooses to load segment 4) or the\n * loaders choose to load the same segment index from each playlist, as the segments may\n * not be aligned perfectly, even for matching segment indexes.\n *\n * @param {Object} timelinechangeController\n * @param {number} currentTimeline\n *        The timeline currently being followed by the loader\n * @param {number} segmentTimeline\n *        The timeline of the segment being loaded\n * @param {('main'|'audio')} loaderType\n *        The loader type\n * @param {boolean} audioDisabled\n *        Whether the audio is disabled for the loader.
